Accessing/regenerating the data:

Run this script in your terminal
- python3 t2-eval.py YOURFILENAME.csv

Interpreting the data:

Positive Values: Indicate positive momentum in the respective factor.
Negative Values: Indicate negative momentum in the respective factor.
For each factor, the magnitude of the value represents the strength of the momentum, with higher positive values indicating stronger positive momentum and lower negative values indicating stronger negative momentum.

Data Visualization: 

The Python script generates a bar chart titled "Stock Counts", which visually represents the frequency of each stock being the top performer based on the provided factors. Here's a breakdown of the visualization:

X-Axis (Stock): Each bar on the chart represents a stock symbol.
Y-Axis (Count): The height of each bar corresponds to the number of times that stock was identified as the top performer.
Title: The title of the chart is "Stock Counts".
Interpreting the Chart
The chart provides insights into the relative performance of different stocks based on the analyzed factors. Stocks with taller bars appear more frequently as the top performers, indicating stronger performance according to the specified factors.
